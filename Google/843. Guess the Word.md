### 843.Guess the Word

This problem is an **interactive problem** new to the LeetCode platform.

We are given a word list of unique words, each word is 6 letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as **secret**.

You may call `master.guess(word)` to guess a word.  The guessed word should have type `string` and must be from the original list with 6 lowercase letters.

This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the **secret word**.  Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.

For each test case, you have 10 guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made 10 or less calls to `master.guess` and at least one of these guesses was the **secret**, you pass the testcase.

Besides the example test case below, there will be 5 additional test cases, each with 100 words in the word list.  The letters of each word in those testcases were chosen independently at random from `'a'` to `'z'`, such that every word in the given word lists is unique.

```
Example 1:
Input: secret = "acckzz", wordlist = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"]

Explanation:

master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.

We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
```

~~~java
/**
 * // This is the Master's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * interface Master {
 *     public int guess(String word) {}
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int match(String a, String b) {
        int matches = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i) if (a.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i)) matches ++;
        return matches;
    }
    
    public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {
        for (int i = 0, x = 0; i < 10 && x < 6; ++i) {
            String guess = wordlist[new Random().nextInt(wordlist.length)];
            x = master.guess(guess);
            List<String> wordlist2 = new ArrayList<>();
            for (String w : wordlist)
                if (match(guess, w) == x)
                    wordlist2.add(w);
            wordlist = wordlist2.toArray(new String[wordlist2.size()]);
        }
    }
}

###每次随机从wordlist中抽出一个字符串与答案比较（调用guess函数）得出相匹配字符串数，记下来。然后遍历wordlist，比较抽出来的字符串与所有字符串的匹配个数，若与之前得到的匹配数相等，则加入新创立的list，遍历完后将list转换为array格式更新为下一次循环的wordlist，这样一步步缩小范围。

## 改进方法

Generally, we will get 0 matches from the `master.guess`.

As a result, the size of `wordlist` reduces slowly.

Here we're going to assume that, we will always run into the worst case.

**We need to guess a word that can minimum our worst outcome.**

So we compare each two words and count their matches.

For each word, we note how many word of 0 matches it gets.

Then we guess the word with minimum words of 0 matches.

In this solution, we apply a minimax idea.

We minimize our worst case,

where the worst case is `max(the number of words with i matches)`

~~~java
public int match(String a, String b) {
        int matches = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i) if (a.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i)) matches ++;
        return matches;
    }
public void findSecretWord(String[] wordlist, Master master) {
        for (int i = 0, x = 0; i < 10 && x < 6; ++i) {
            HashMap<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
            for (String w1 : wordlist)
                for (String w2 : wordlist)
                    if (match(w1, w2) == 0)
                        count.put(w1, count.getOrDefault(w1 , 0) + 1);
            Pair<String, Integer> minimax = new Pair<>("", 1000);
            for (String w : wordlist)
                if (count.getOrDefault(w, 0) < minimax.getValue())
                    minimax = new Pair<>(w, count.getOrDefault(w, 0));
            x = master.guess(minimax.getKey());
            List<String> wordlist2 = new ArrayList<String>();
            for (String w : wordlist)
                if (match(minimax.getKey(), w) == x)
                    wordlist2.add(w);
            wordlist = wordlist2.toArray(new String[0]);
        }
    }
