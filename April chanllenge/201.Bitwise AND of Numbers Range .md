Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0
```

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        if(m ==0) return 0;
        int i = 0;//i means how many zeros on the right
        
        while(m!=n){
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            i++;
        }
        return m << i;
        
    }
}

###The hardest part of this problem is to find the regular pattern.
For example, for number `26 to 30`
Their binary form are:
`11010`
`11011`
`11100`　　
`11101`　　
`11110`



Because we are trying to find bitwise AND, so if any bit there are at least one `0` and one `1`, it always `0`. In this case, it is `11000`.
So we are go to cut all these bit that they are different. In this case we cut the right `3` bit.
