### 957. Prison Cells After N Days

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: `cells[i] == 1` if the `i`-th cell is occupied, else `cells[i] == 0`.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after `N` days (and `N` such changes described above.)

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

**Note:**

1. `cells.length == 8`
2. `cells[i]` is in `{0, 1}`
3. `1 <= N <= 10^9`

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        if(cells == null || cells.length == 0){
            return cells;
        }
        boolean hasCycle = false;
        int cycle =0;
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int n =0;n<N;n++){
            int[] next = nextday(cells);
            String key = Arrays.toString(next);
            if(!set.contains(key)){
                set.add(key);
                cycle++;
            }
            else{
                hasCycle = true;
                break;
            }
            cells = next;
            
        }
        
        if(hasCycle == true){
            N%=cycle;
            for(int n =0;n<N;n++){
                cells = nextday(cells);
            }
        }
        return cells;
        
    }
    
    private int[] nextday(int[] cells){
        int[] temp = new int[cells.length];
        for(int i =1;i<cells.length-1;i++){
            temp[i] = cells[i-1] ==cells[i+1]? 1:0;
        }
        return temp;
        
    }
}
~~~

Another easy way

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        int rem = ((N-1)%14)+1;
	int temp[] = new int[cells.length];
	for(int day=0; day<rem; day++) {
		for(int i=1; i<temp.length-1; i++) 
			temp[i] = cells[i-1]==cells[i+1]? 1 : 0;
		System.arraycopy(temp, 0, cells, 0, cells.length);
	}
	return cells;
    }
}

###the length of loop can be 1, 7, or 14.  So once we enter the loop, every 14 steps must be the same state.
