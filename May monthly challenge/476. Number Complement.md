### 476. Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int sum =0;
        int i =0;
        while(sum<num){
            sum += Math.pow(2,i);
            i++;
        }
        return sum-num;
    }
}
~~~

for example:
100110, its complement is 011001, the sum is 111111. So we only need get the min number large or equal to num, then do substraction
