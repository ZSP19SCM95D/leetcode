### 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than *O*(*n*2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length > 1){
            int slow = nums[0];
            int fast = nums[nums[0]];
            while (slow != fast){
                
                slow = nums[slow];
                fast = nums[nums[fast]];
            }

            fast = 0;
            while (fast != slow){
                
                fast = nums[fast];
                slow = nums[slow];
            } 
            return slow;
        }
        return -1;

    }
}

f there is no duplicate in the array, we can map each indexes to each numbers in this array. In other words, we can have a mapping function `f(index) = number`
For example, let's assume
`nums = [2,1,3]`, then the mapping function is `0->2, 1->1, 2->3`.

如果数组里面无重复的，则我们可以用索引—>数字来存

However, if there is duplicate in the array, the mapping function is many-to-one.
For example, let's assume

`nums = [2,1,3,1]`, then the mapping function is `0->2, {1,3}->1, 2->3`. Then the sequence we get definitely has a cycle. `0->2->3->1->1->1->1->1->.......`. The starting point of this cycle is the duplicate number.
