### 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

~~~java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return "1"; 
        String prev = countAndSay(n - 1); 
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        while(i < prev.length()) {
            char curr = prev.charAt(i);
            int j = 0;
            while(i+j < prev.length() && prev.charAt(i+j) == curr) j++;
            str.append(j);
            str.append(curr);
            i += j;
        }
        return str.toString();
    }
}
~~~

This problem can be simply said as the nth term is the read-off of the (n - 1)th term.Everytime using parameter j as the number of same digits.When finished, skip to the next different digit by i += j;
