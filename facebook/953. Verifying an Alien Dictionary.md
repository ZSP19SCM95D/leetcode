### 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= words.length <= 100`

2. `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`

3. `order.length == 26`

4. All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are english lowercase letters.

   ~~~java
   class Solution {
       int[] dic = new int[26];
       public boolean isAlienSorted(String[] words, String order) {
           for(int n=0; n<order.length();n++){
               dic[order.charAt(n)-'a'] = n;
           }
           for(int n=1; n<words.length;n++){
               if(compare(words[n-1],words[n])>0) return false;
           }
           return true;
           
       }
       
       public int compare(String w1,String w2){
           int n1 = w1.length(), n2 = w2.length(), comp = 0;
           for(int i =0, j=0;i<n1&&j<n2&&comp ==0;i++,j++){
               comp = dic[w1.charAt(i)-'a']-dic[w2.charAt(j)-'a'];
           }
           return comp == 0? n1-n2:comp;
       }
   }
