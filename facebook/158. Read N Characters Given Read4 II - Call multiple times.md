### 158. Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times

Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read *n* characters. **Your method read may be called multiple times.**

 

**Method read4:**

The API `read4` reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

**Definition of read4:**

```
    Parameter:  char[] buf
    Returns:    int

Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
```

Below is a high level example of how `read4` works:

```
File file("abcdefghijk"); // File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "efgh", fp points to 'i'
read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = "ijk", fp points to end of file
```

~~~java
/**
 * The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
 *     int read4(char[] buf); 
 */
public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    
    private int buffPointer = 0;
    private int buffCount = 0;
    private char[] temp = new char[4];
    
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int pointer = 0;
        while(pointer<n){
            if(buffPointer == 0){//no remaining characters in the temp
                buffCount = read4(temp);
            }
            if(buffCount == 0){
                break;//end of file
            }
            while(pointer<n && buffPointer<buffCount){
                buf[pointer++] = temp[buffPointer++];
            }
            if(buffPointer>=buffCount){
                buffPointer = 0;
            }
        }
        return pointer;
        
    }
}

### 它和Leetcode 157的不同之处就在于read(char *buf, int n)方法可能被调用多次，这样就产生了一个问题：上一次调用时读到buffer中的内容可能没有被取尽，所以下次调用read方法时，需要优先从上次没有读完的buffer中读取数据。
