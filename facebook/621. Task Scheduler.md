### 621. Task Scheduler

Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval **n** that means between two **same tasks**, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the **least** number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B. 
```

**Note:**

1. The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2. The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] c = new int[26];
        for(char t : tasks){
            c[t - 'A']++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(c);
        int i = 25;
        while(i >= 0 && c[i] == c[25]) i--;
        
        //c[25]为字母的最大出现次数，c[25]减去1是分成的块数,n+1是每个块中间的字母个数，25-i是还需补齐的个数（最后面）
      //跟task的length比较是我们最后返回的结果肯定不能小于task的长度，当n=0时会出现结果小于task长度的情况所以要比较取大值。
        return Math.max(tasks.length, (c[25] - 1) * (n + 1) + 25 - i);
        
        
    }
}
~~~
