### 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

  ~~~java
  class Solution {
      public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
          int red =0, white =0, blue=nums.length-1;
          while(white<=blue){
              if(nums[white]==1){
                  white++;
                  continue;
              }
              else if(nums[white]==0){
                  swap(nums,red,white);
                  white++;
                  red++;
              }
              else{
                  swap(nums,white,blue);
                  blue--;
              }
          }
          
      }
      
      private void swap(int[] nums,int i, int j){
          int temp = nums[i];
          nums[i] =nums[j];
          nums[j] =temp;
      }
  }
