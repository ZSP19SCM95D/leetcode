### 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of *O*(log *n*).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

~~~java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right =nums.length-1;
        while(left<= right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            else if(nums[mid]>=nums[left]){
                //说明从开始到中间这段没有发生翻转，还是递增
                if(target >=nums[left] && target<nums[mid]){
                    right = mid-1;
                }
                else left = mid +1;
            }
            else{
                //剩下的情况就是发生了rotate
                if(target<= nums[right] && target > nums[mid]){
                    left = mid+1;
                }
                else right = mid-1;  
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
